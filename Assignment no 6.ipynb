    "# Question no 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## object oriented programing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### object oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm in which real world object are each viewed as separate entities having their own state which is modified only by built in procedures called method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modular Structure:\n",
    "####    It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reused\n",
    "####    Objects can also be reused within an across applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easier to Maintain\n",
    "####    It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method is associated by its name, but it is associated to an object(dependent).\n",
    "#### A method is implicitly passed by the boject on which it is invoked.\n",
    "#### It may or not return any data.\n",
    "#### A method can operate on the data(instance variables) that is contained by the corresponding class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function is block of code that is also called by its name(independent).\n",
    "#### The function can have different parameters or may not have any at all. If any data(parameters) are passed, they are passsed explicitly.\n",
    "#### It may or not return any data.\n",
    "#### Function does not deal with class and its instance concept.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no 4\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A collection of data (fields/ variables) and methods that operate on that data. OR It is a template or blue print about the capability of what an object can do.\n",
    "#### Data/methods define the contents/capabilities of the instances (objects) of the class.\n",
    "#### A class can be viewed as a factory for objects.\n",
    "#### A class defines a recipe for its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A thing that has identity, state, and behavior. It is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates OR objects interact with each other , and it is defined by the operations an object can perform.\n",
